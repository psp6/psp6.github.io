   <h4> <u> Health Expenditure Survey </u>. </h4>
   
   <h4> Context </h4>
   
   <p> India spends about ~ 1.1% of its GDP on healthcare. With such lower levels of public health expenditure, health system 
     in India is pre-dominantly private in nature-- people seek care at private facilities and mostly had to pay out-of-their pocket at the point of care. This is in contrast to health systems that offer health services funded either through tax (fully or partly) or through pre-payment mechanisms in which financial burden to indiviual persons are reduced. As individual persons and households bear the cost of health services, it poses a financial challeng especially in low middle income households. It could also lead to impoverishment if the health care costs are higher and households had to forego use of other goods and services that might affect their overall wellbeing. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Data on household health expenditures are collected through <a href = ""> national sample surveys (NSS) </a> , a large,    representative survey of households in urban and rural India. The survey requires household members to recall visits to healthcare facilities and resulting expenditures occured in the past ranging from 7 days to 1 month for acute illnesses and out-patient visits and 1 year for hospitatizations. The precision of this data depends on participants ability to recall which is known to be biased due to either compression or expansion of time. Participants could either compress time in which events could be moved out of the reference period or vice versa. This affects both the magnitude and composition of expenditure estimates. 
  </p>
   
  <p> In this research, we are interested to find if survey data collection on health expenditures can be improved by using smartphones with <a href = ""> applications (apps) </a> that can act as diaries for participants to record their expenditures in near real-time. This overcomes the limitation of recall biases by being real-time to when events occur and also provide additional benefits in terms of reducing lags between the time of data collection and the final analysis and presentation. We want to know 1: consistency of usage of app.. for recording expenditures and 2: quality of recorded expenditure data. This research will show the quality of smartphone based diary data with its consistency, useful metrics for implementation in larger scales.    </p>
