   <h4> <u> Health Expenditure Survey </u>. </h4>
   
   <h5> Context </h5>
   
   <p> India spends about ~ 1.1% of its GDP on healthcare. With such lower levels of public health expenditure, health system 
     in India is pre-dominantly private in nature wherein people had to pay out-of-their pocket for utilizing healthcare services 
     at the point of care. This is in contrast to health systems which offers either tax-funded provision of health car or 
     through range of pre-payment services in which financial burden to indiviual persons are reduced. As individual persons and 
     households bear the cost of health services, it poses a financial challenge to them especially in low middle income households.
     Often, these households may have to forego use of other goods and services that might affect their overall wellbeing. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Data on household health expenditures are collected through <a href = ""> national sample surveys (NSS) </a> , a large,    representative survey of household in urban and rural India. The survey requires household members to recall visits to healthcare facilities and resulting expenditures that have occured in the past that ranges from 7 days to 1 month and 1 year. The precision of resulting data depends on participants ability to recall their visits and expenditures. </p>
