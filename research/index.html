   <h4> <u> Health Expenditure Survey </u>. </h4>
   
   <h4> Context </h4>
   
   <p> India spends about ~ 1.1% of its GDP on healthcare. With such lower levels of public health expenditure, health system 
     in India is pre-dominantly private in nature wherein people seek care at private facilities and mostly had to pay out-of-their pocket for utilizing healthcare services at the point of care. This is in contrast to health systems that offer health services funded either through tax (fully or partly) or through pre-payment mechanisms in which financial burden to indiviual persons are reduced. As individual persons and households bear the cost of health services, it poses a financial challenge to them especially in low middle income households. Often, it could lead to impoverishment if the costs are higher and households had to forego use of other goods and services that might affect their overall wellbeing. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Data on household health expenditures are collected through <a href = ""> national sample surveys (NSS) </a> , a large,    representative survey of households in urban and rural India. The survey requires household members to recall visits to healthcare facilities and resulting expenditures occured in the past ranging from 7 days to 1 month for acute illnesses and out-patient visits and 1 year for hospitatizations. The precision of resulting utlization and expenditures data depends on participants ability to recall which is known to biased to either compression or expansion of time. Participants could either compress time in which events could be moved out of the reference period or vice versa. This affects both the magnitude and composition of expenditure estimates.
