          <p> I work as Biostatistician with <a href = "www.wtrl.in"> The Wellcome Trust Research Lab </a> in 
                Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore. My current interests are with household health care utilization 
                and expenditures toward it, and with tweaking data collection methods using modern mobile technology to provide such data in timely fashion.
                Currently, we are <a href = "/research"> researching </a> whether smartphone based applications (apps) will be feasible 
                to be used in household surveys to collect household expenditure data.</p> 
                
           <p> Statistics is often formulaic. But what few people knew is that there is a quite of randomness/uncertainty in each step
                that could make skip part-by-part structure.   Most important contributions are in the areas of sample size calculations 
                and in developing plan for analysis that riffs through other aspects as well, including hypothesis formulation, 
                 primary objectives and outcomes. </p>
                
             <p> Other activities include teaching and training in undertaking data analysis in research studies. I use R software for data analysis.
            </p>
            
            <p> I received a bachelors from Loyola Colllege in Chennai, which was fun with mix of strict and chill teachers around. 
                  And then did both Masters and PhD in Biostatistics from CMC, Vellore. </p>
